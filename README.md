# Global-data-tracker- COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

## Project Description
This project analyzes COVID-19 data focusing on Kenya, India, and the United States. Using the latest available dataset(owid-covid-data.csv), the project visualizes the progression of cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time to provide insights into the pandemic’s impact and vaccination efforts across these countries.

## Objectives
- Import and clean COVID-19 data for selected countries.
- Explore trends in total and new COVID-19 cases and deaths over time.
- Visualize vaccination rollout progress.
- Compare pandemic dynamics between Kenya, India, and the United States.
- Provide insights to better understand the pandemic’s evolution and response.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)
- NumPy (for numerical operations)

## How to Run/View the Project
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 and the required libraries installed. 

Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`Global tracker.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Run the cells sequentially to view the data processing, analysis, and visualizations.

## Insights and Reflections
- The COVID-19 pandemic has affected each country differently, with the US and India showing significantly higher case and death counts compared to Kenya.
- Vaccination rollouts have varied in speed and scale, with India and the US showing rapid progress while Kenya’s vaccination rates are still growing.
- Visualizing new cases and deaths over time reveals the timing of waves and surges, highlighting the importance of ongoing monitoring and public health measures.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing are crucial steps for accurate and meaningful analysis, especially when handling real-world datasets with missing or inconsistent values.
